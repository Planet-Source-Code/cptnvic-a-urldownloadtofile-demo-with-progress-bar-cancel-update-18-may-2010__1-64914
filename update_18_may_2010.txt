Update: 18 May, 2010

Repaired: BINDF_GETNEWESTVERSION (noted long ago and correction posted in comments... now repaired in class code.)

Repaired: IBindStatusCallback_OnStopBinding Sub
	Previously allowed S_OK to be processed as a handled error... when it was not an error.
	Thanks to David for letting me know about this behavior... sorry it took so long to get fixed.	

Added: S_OK As Long = &H0 declaration (see above)
	Actually, S_OK is declared in the TLB... here again for your notice.

Class_Terminate:
	Added a class terminate sub... just to be safe.
	Simarly, added a form unload to remove class safely.
